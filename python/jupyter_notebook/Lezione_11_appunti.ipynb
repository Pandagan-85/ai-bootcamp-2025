    "# Differenze tra i due codici di scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Struttura e navigazione tra le pagine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice mio (Primo esempio)\n",
    "- **Approccio**: Usa un ciclo `while` per navigare tra le pagine numerate (come `page-1.html`, `page-2.html`).\n",
    "- **Crawl per pagina**: Ogni pagina viene visitata una volta, e i dati dei libri vengono estratti dalla pagina attuale.\n",
    "- **Controllo delle pagine**: Avanza alla pagina successiva finché esistono pagine disponibili, basandosi su un incremento numerico nel link (`page-1`, `page-2`, ecc.) e controllando se la pagina successiva esiste.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice Rigel (Secondo esempio)\n",
    "- **Approccio**: Usa un **crawling ricorsivo** (algoritmo BFS — Breadth First Search), dove visita i link trovati in ogni pagina in modo **dinamico**.\n",
    "- **Crawl per link**: Esplora ogni link trovato nella pagina (se il link è valido e non è già stato visitato), e poi prosegue visitando il link successivo in modalità ricorsiva.\n",
    "- **Controllo delle pagine**: Non segue un numero fisso di pagine, ma continua a esplorare i link trovati fino a quando non si esauriscono i collegamenti validi.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Gestione dei dati\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice mio (Primo esempio)\n",
    "- **Raccolta dei dati**: I dati vengono raccolti in un **DataFrame di Pandas**, con una lista di dizionari che contiene le informazioni estratte da ogni libro.\n",
    "- **Dettagli del libro**: Vengono estratti il titolo, il prezzo e i dettagli extra da una tabella HTML specifica e aggiunti a un elenco `book_data`.\n",
    "- **Struttura dei dati**: Ogni libro è rappresentato da un dizionario che contiene informazioni come il titolo, il prezzo e altri dettagli (come la disponibilità).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice Rigel (Secondo esempio)\n",
    "- **Raccolta dei dati**: I dati vengono salvati in una lista chiamata `data`. Ogni volta che vengono trovati dati pertinenti in una tabella (convertiti in dizionari dalla funzione `rows_to_dict`), vengono aggiunti alla lista `data`.\n",
    "- **Dettagli**: I dati vengono estratti dalle tabelle HTML che appaiono nelle pagine visitate, non solo dai libri, ma da tutti i dati tabulari presenti.\n",
    "- **Salvataggio dei dati**: I dati vengono infine salvati in formato JSON nel file `books.json`, oltre a essere mostrati in un DataFrame di Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Ottimizzazione e gestione dei link\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice mio (Primo esempio)\n",
    "- **URL assoluti**: Costruisce manualmente gli URL completi per ogni libro visitato, ma non gestisce esplicitamente i link relativi a meno che non siano trasformati in assoluti.\n",
    "- **Navigazione fra pagine**: Il crawler segue un percorso fisso attraverso le pagine numerate senza esplorare altri collegamenti interni.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice Rigel (Secondo esempio)\n",
    "- **Gestione dei link**: Utilizza un set `ignored` per tenere traccia dei link già visitati, evitando di visitare più volte lo stesso URL. Questo è fatto in tempo costante grazie all'uso del set.\n",
    "- **Link relativi**: Quando trova link relativi, li trasforma in link assoluti utilizzando la URL base, il che gli permette di seguire anche i link che non sono completamente formati.\n",
    "- **Navigazione dinamica**: Esplora ogni link trovato nella pagina in modo dinamico, senza un limite prefissato sul numero di pagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Esperienza utente e gestione del traffico\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice mio (Primo esempio)\n",
    "- **Paginazione manuale**: Si naviga solo tra pagine numerate con un limite prefissato (ad esempio, fermandosi a 10 libri), utile per scenari in cui si desidera limitare il numero di pagine esplorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice Rigel (Secondo esempio)\n",
    "- **Pausa tra richieste**: Aggiunge un ritardo tra le richieste (con `time.sleep(1)`) per evitare di sovraccaricare il server, un approccio utile per non causare blocchi o rallentamenti nei siti web.\n",
    "- **Crawl completo e ricorsivo**: Non ha un limite predeterminato sul numero di pagine o link esplorati, ma continua a seguire e raccogliere i link fino a che non ci sono più URL validi da visitare.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Sintesi delle differenze\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice mio (Primo esempio)\n",
    "- **Approccio semplice e lineare** per navigare tra le pagine numerate di un sito.\n",
    "- **Limitato** a un numero fisso di libri o pagine.\n",
    "- **Raccolta dei dati** in un DataFrame di Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codice Rigel (Secondo esempio)\n",
    "- **Crawling ricorsivo dinamico** che esplora ogni link trovato, senza limiti di pagine.\n",
    "- **Gestione avanzata dei link** con tracciamento degli URL già visitati.\n",
    "- **Raccolta dei dati** in formato JSON, con possibilità di estrarre anche altri tipi di tabelle oltre ai libri.\n",
    "- **Approccio più flessibile** e adatto a siti con architetture di navigazione più complesse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quale scegliere?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Se il sito ha una **paginazione semplice** (con pagine numerate), **Codice mio** è più adatto.\n",
    "- Se vuoi esplorare un sito con una **struttura di link complessa** o desideri raccogliere informazioni da tutte le pagine collegate in un sito, **Codice Rigel** con il crawling ricorsivo è la scelta migliore.\n",
